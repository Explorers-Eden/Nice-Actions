## Changes:
- Added a proper message when a player tries to teleport home but has none
- Last Death Location message now shows the location of the last Grave and whether it's looted or not instead of Last Death Location when [Nice Keep Inventory](https://modrinth.com/datapack/nice-keep-inventory) is also installed and Graves are enabled
- Teleporting Home now also teleports leashed mobs, ridden mounts and nearby tamed pets that do not sit (Cat, Parrot, Wolf)

## Fixes:
- Villager info not displaying position of the villager
